# Design Pattern Examples #

## Observer Pattern ##

The Observer Pattern defines a one (Subject) to many (Observers) relationships between objects.
So when an object (Subject) state changes every dependent objects (Observers) are notified and updated automatically.

In my example, I used the Publisher (Subject) / Subscriber (Observers) analogy.
For the Publisher, thinks Devil Wears Prada, for the Subscribers well, think about you.

Another analogy, is thinking about [Paperboy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy_(video_game) "Paperboy") for the notifyObservers() method. Imagining him running to deliver the last newspaper (state changed).
